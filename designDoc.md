Besides the technologies I use, look at the part about 
test-utils, including example to mock with router and store, which was kind of tricky.

## Typescript

Typescript for type safety and self-documenting code.
Well, I did not use the full force of Typescript here (many any types)
Why? Its time consuming.

## Formik

I use formik and yup (for validation) for forms. 
Its standardized and relatively easy to use.
I've been building a lot of forms with React and its always a headache especially
if you do it yourself.
My developer experience with Formik is good.

## Table <table>

We have tabular data so I used a table.

## useReducer and useContext

I use useReducer and useContext here, mainly for the routing component.
But its also good in terms of extensibility for the app
